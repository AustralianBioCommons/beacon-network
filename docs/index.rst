Beacon Network Services
=======================

Beacon Network is a set of services that create a hub for using Beacon APIs. These services are designed and developed by `GA4GH <https://www.ga4gh.org/>`_  and `ELIXIR <https://elixir-europe.org/>`_ partner organisations.

As of this moment, Beacon Network consists of four components:

* Registry API
* Aggregator API
* Auth API
* Client UI

This ecosystem serves to provide wider access and GUI to third party Beacons. For more information on Beacon APIs, the end services of this software family, see the following links:
